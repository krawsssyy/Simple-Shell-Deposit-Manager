# Simple-Shell-Deposit-Manager

This is a simple program written in Bash. This program loads some information from a file called "deposit.csv" where each line is of the following format : 'material, quantity'.
The program takes in command-line arguments as transport files, which can be IN or OUT(specified on the first line), and then adds or respectively subtracts the quantity of material from the deposit.
Then the program saves the changes in the original "deposit.csv" file.
